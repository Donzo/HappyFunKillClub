# Happy Fun Kill Club

Happy Fun Kill Club is an engaging 2-player, turn-based card game set in a vibrant, futuristic world. It's accessible to anyone with a hot wallet like MetaMask and offers fast-paced, strategic gameplay.

# PACKS Tokens

All players who sign-in to the server receive a starter deck and can play right away. Players who enjoy the game may [purchase PACKS tokens](https://happyfunkillclub.com/?buyCards=true&skipPrompt=true), which can be spent to MINT NFT cards of varying rarity determined by the results of a Chainlink VRF request. 

These NFT cards can be used [in the game](https://happyfunkillclub.com/game/). But no player is required to purchase any cards to play. All players who sign in to the server receive a starter deck.

# RedCoin and the RedCoin Shop

Players earn RedCoin for winning and completing matchmaking games against other players. RedCoin can be minted via a [contract that uses Chainlink Functions](https://github.com/Donzo/HappyFunKillClub/blob/main/code/sol/cl-functions-mint-redcoin.sol), which queries [this PHP file](https://github.com/Donzo/HappyFunKillClub/blob/main/code/php/mint-redcoin-check.php) to determine how much RedCoin the player has available to mint.  

RedCoin can be spent at [the RedCoin Shop](https://happyfunkillclub.com/?redCoinStore=true&skipPrompt=true) where players can MINT NFT items, such as [armor](https://happyfunkillclub.com/cards/items/level-2-bulletproof-vest/card.jpg), [medical care](https://happyfunkillclub.com/cards/items/intermediate-first-aid-kit/card.jpg), and [other futuristic equipment](https://happyfunkillclub.com/cards/items/advanced-assisted-optics/card.jpg).

The RedCoin shop uses [Chainlink Automation](https://automation.chain.link/) to update the NFT items weekly.
